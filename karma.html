<h3>
&#9830; The inexorable workings of Karma! 

</h3>
 <p> <br><br>
As an illustration of how Karma works and how it sneaks up on Villains it's instructive to recount the following:
 <br><br>
A very poor and unfortunate family came to our attention while our Charitable Trust to help the poor was conducting surveys.
<br>
This pitiable family is living in absolute misery and squalor; the father has lost both his legs to one of the hundreds of millions of bombs littering the landscape while tending his field, bombs dropped by the US of Atrocities in one of their satanical Wars for Profit.
Two of the children suffer from horrific congenital Birth Defects, due to the Agent Orange poison the US of Terrorism sprayed onto the Forests and Fields, and one child is severely retarded, also due to the US of Atrocities' Crimes against Humanity, spraying Dioxin by the millions of tons!
But what we'd like to convey to you is the fact that one child, a severely handicapped boy, at age three started to talk about his ‘real family' and people he said lived in a village somewhere not far from his home.
After endlessly persisting he would like to go to this village the family took him there and he immediately identified a whole group of people he had never seen before in his present life.
It turned out that in his previous life he lived there and was a well to do money lender.
 <br><br>
He was also a very much loathed and despised crook as he used his unscrupulous lending practices to rip off people and on the slightest hint of ‘default', or anyone being late in paying interest he confiscated peoples' properties, lands, houses and fields which he always took as security. (Sounds familiar?)
 <br><br>
Until one day an enraged Victim of his, only four years previously, stabbed him to death in a fit of rage and revenge.
The whole village celebrated his departure as he was such a ruthless and much reviled moneylender.
But what's also even more remarkable is hat the little boy has scars at the exact same locations where his previous incarnation was stabbed to death!
This is quite a common occurrence and has been reported by many others investigating reincarnations.
The salient lessons of this story must be abundantly clear;
 <br><br>
&#9658; Karma is an undeniable fact & Banksters will suffer Hell for millions of Lifetimes to come!
 <br><br>
&#9658; Predatory Money Lending is an evil, vile and criminal activity and any person engaged in this vile pursuit will incur the most horrific, toxic Karma!
(Let alone all the Crimes, Fraud, Market rigging, Deceptions and Theft the WS Banksters/Fed/BIS/CBs/IMF/WS Matrix of Crime perpetrates on an epic scale.
The entire ‘business model' of this matrix is based on Fraud, Crime and the destruction of the Productive People's Money; Gold and Silver!)
 <br><br>
&#9658; The US of Atrocities, controlled by the WS/MIC Matrix of Evil spreads unimaginable Misery, Death, Destruction and Suffering and will incur, through Karma, the same Suffering it spreads with its Evil Deeds and Crimes against Humanity.
(The present collapse of the Fiat Currency Crime Racket is a sign that the end is nigh and Karma is coming to the US of Atrocities)
 <br><br>
&#9658; There is only one way to escape this horrific Karmic retribution!
And that's to make amends, pay Reparations and recompense one's Victim to the full extent - and then some!
 <br><br>
&#9658; Karma will ALWAYS have to be repaid – without fail!
 <br><br>
&#9658;&#9658; There is no hiding behind glitzy corporate façades and behind gold plated marbled Board Room doors; Crimes are committed by Individuals and not Corporations. Karma will get you wherever you are!
 <br><br>
There is no phantom Yahweh, God, Lucifer, or whatever deranged, satanical fantasy deity parasitic Banksters are propitiating who will save them!
<br>
Now this Money Lender was, by WS Bankster standards, just a small time crook, so imagine the horrific toxic Karma the parasitic WS Banksters have incurred; Tens of thousands of Lifetimes in utter Squalor, Agony and Misery, like this wretched poor little boy!
