    <h3><b>✘</b> For what Reasons was WW2 fought and who instigated this
      Atrocity</h3>
    <p>World War 2 makes for an interesting Case Study as to <b>why</b> Wars
      are fought at all and Cui Bono! <br>
      This applies to all wars, and as we shall see, it is even admitted and
      boasted about by the Main Actors behind the scene, if they think no one is
      paying close attention!</p>
    <h3> A look behind the facade of all the Propaganda, Lies and Deceptions
      reveals a very different picture of motivations, modus operandi, intrigues
      and machinations which led to all the&nbsp; Wars, Misery, Suffering, Death
      &amp; Destruction than what we've been led to believe! </h3>
    <h3> It is all conducted by a Cabal of Banksters, Secret Societies, Zionists
      and their Politician Whores, which, thanks to their control over the <b>deliberately
        created, artificial Financial System</b>, have the ability to print
      almost infinite amounts of Fiat Currency out of thin Air, and thus have
      accrued infinite Wealth and Power over the entire global Institutions and
      Governments! <br>
      In their own Words:<br>

              twelve years and even the woman of 84 years had been raped. After
