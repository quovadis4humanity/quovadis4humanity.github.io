<h3>&#9670; For what Reasons was WW2 fought and who instigated this Atrocity</h3>
<p>World War 2 makes for an interesting Case Study as to <b>why</b> Wars are fought at all and Cui Bono!
<br>
This applies to all wars, and as we shall see, it is even admitted and boasted about by the Main Actors behind the scene, if they think no one is paying close attention!</p>


<h3>
A look behind the facade of all the Propaganda, Lies and Deceptions 
        reveals a very different picture of motivations, modus operandi, 
        intrigues and machinations which led to all the&nbsp; Wars, Misery, 
        Suffering, Death &amp; Destruction than what we've been led to believe!

</h3>


</h3>




		<h3>

		It is all conducted by a Cabal of Banksters, Secret Societies, Zionists 
        and their Politician Whores;<br>In their own Words:<br><br>

  <li>"<i>As long as the Jews do not hold Germany they can never realize their final aim - World Domination.
<br>
Therefore Hitler must be overthrown and Jewish power restored." </i>
<br>
Nesta Webster, British Historian in 'Germany and England 1938
<br><br>
  </li>
  <li>
<i>"It is untrue that I or anyone else in Germany wanted war in 1939. It was wanted and provoked solely by international statesmen either of Jewish origin or working for Jewish interests. Nor had I ever wished that after the appalling first World War, there would ever be a second against either England or America."
</i> 

<br>
Adolf Hitler (April 1945)
<br><br>
  </li>
  <li>
<i>"Played golf with Joe Kennedy (U.S. Ambassador to Britain). He says that Chamberlain stated that America and world Jewry forced England into World War II."
</i>
<br>
James Forrestal, Secretary of the Navy (later Secretary of Defence), Diary, December 27, 1945 entry.
<br><br>

  </li>
  <li>
<i>"Now we have forced Hitler to war so he no longer can peacefully annihilate one piece of the Treaty of Versailles after the other."
</i>
<br>
Lord Halifax, English ambassador in Washington (1939)
<br><br>

  </li>
  <li>
<i>"Not the political doctrine of Hitler has hurled us into this war. The reason was the success of his increase in building a new economy. The roots of war were envy, greed and fear."
</i>
<br>
Major General J.F.C. Fuller, historian, England
<br><br>
  </li>
  <li>
<i>"I asked Joe Kennedy (US embassador in London) about his talks with Roosevelt and N. Chamberlain in 1938. He said it had been Chamberlains belief in 1939 that Great Britain has nothing in its hands to fight and therefore wouldn’t dare to go to war against Hitler...Neither the French nor the English would have made Poland a motive for war if they hadn’t been continuously spurred on by Washington...America and the World-Jewry have driven England to war."
</i>
<br>
US defence minister J. Forrestal 27.12.1945 in his diary (The Forrestal Diaries, New York, 1951, S. 121 ff)

Roosevelt 1932

  <li>
<i>"The enemy is the German Reich and not Nazism, and those who still haven't understood this, haven't understood anything."
</i>
<br>
Churchill’s chief counsellor Robert Lord Vansittart (September 1940 to foreign minister Lord Halifax)
<br><br>

  </li>
  <li>
<i>"We won this war with atrocity propaganda ... and now we will start more than ever! We will continue this atrocity propaganda, we will increase it until nobody will accept one good word from the Germans anymore, until everything is destroyed which might have upheld them sympathies in other countries, and until they will be so confused that they don’t know what to do anymore. When this is reached, when they begin to pollute their own nest, and this not reluctantly but with hasty willingness to obey the winners, only then the victory is complete. It will never be definite. The re-education demands thorough, steadfast nurture like English lawn. Only one moment of inattention and the weed will break through, this in-eradicable weed of historic truth."
</i>
<br>
Sefton Delmer, former British chief propagandist after the capitulation in 1945 to the German expert on international law Prof. Grimm.
<br><br>


  </li>
  <li>
<i>"We didn't go to war in 1939 to save Germany from Hitler...or the continent from fascism. Like in 1914 we went to war for the not lesser noble cause that we couldn’t accept a German hegemony over Europe."
</i>
<br>
Sunday Correspondent, London (17.9.1989)
<br><br>


  </li>
  <li>
<i>"We want to bring about a deep hatred for the Germans, for German soldiers, sailors, and airmen. We must hate until we win."
</i>
<br>
Lord Beaverbrook, quoted in Niemals! by Heinrich Goitsch.
<br><br>

  </li>
  <li>
<i>"Hitler and the German people didn't want this war. We didn't answer Hitler’s various petitions for peace. Now we have to admit that he was right. Instead of a cooperation with Germany, which he had offered us, now stands the gigantic, imperialistic might of the Soviets. I feel ashamed to see how the same intentions which we accused Hitler of now are pursued under a different name."
</i>
<br>
Sir Hartley Shawcross, British chief-accuser in Nuremberg
<br><br>


  </li>
  <li>
<i>"East Prussia is unquestionable German territory. Since my childhood this is my opinon which didnt need the affirmation by a plebiscite. And that this is my opinion you may tell your East Prussians in a public gathering in Knigsberg for reassurance."
</i>
<br>
The president of the Polish state and Marshall Josef Pilsudski who mysteriously lost his life in the 1930s, to the German foreign minister Gustav Stresemann (10th December 1927) 
<br><br>

  </li>
  <li>
<i>"The minorities in Poland are supposed to disappear. The Polish policy makes sure that they dont only disappear on the paper. This policy is ruthlessly established and without any attention to the public opinion of the world, of international contracts or the League of Nations. The Ukraine turned to hell under Polish rule. One can say this about Belorussia with even more right. The purpose of the Polish policy is the disappearance of the national minorities on the paper and in reality."

Manchester Guardian (14th December 1931) 
<br><br>

  </li>
  <li>

<i>"It is not the Germany of the first decade that followed the war - broken, dejected and bowed down with a sense of apprehension and impotence. It is now full of hope and confidence, and of a renewed sense of determination to lead its own life without interference from any influence outside its own frontiers. One man has accomplished this miracle. He is a born leader of men. A magnetic and dynamic personality with a single-minded purpose, a resolute will and a dauntless heart."

<i>"What we didn't want to comprehend in the German (anti-Hitler) resistance during the war, we learned completely afterwards: this war wasn’t led against Hitler but against Germany."
</i>
<br>
Eugen Gerstenmaier, President of the German Bundestag since 1954, member of the resistance group "Bekennende Kirche" during WW2
<br><br>

  </li>
  <li>
<i>"We made a monster, a devil out of Hitler. Therefore we couldn’t disavow it after the war. After all, we mobilized the masses against the devil himself. So we were forced to play our part in this diabolic scenario after the war. In no way we could have pointed out to our people that the war only was an economic preventive measure."

  </li>
  <li>
<i>"In no country has the historical blackout been more intense and effective than in Great Britain. Here it has been ingeniously christened The Iron Curtain of Discreet Silence. Virtually nothing has been written to reveal the truth about British responsibility for the Second World War and its disastrous results."
</i> 
<br>
Harry Elmer Barnes. American Historian
<br><br>
  </li>
  <li>
<i>"The fact is that the only real offer of security which Poland received in 1938 and 1939 emanated from Hitler. 
<br>
He offered to guarantee the boundaries laid down in the Versailles Treaty against every other country. Even the Weimar Republic had not for a moment taken this into consideration. Whatever one may think of Hitler's government or foreign policy, no doubt exists on this point; his proposals to Poland in 1938/39 were reasonable and just and the most moderate of all which he made during the six years of his efforts to revise the Versailles Treaty by peaceful means."
</i> 
<br>
Professor Harry Elmer Barnes, American Historian
<br><br>
  </li>
  <li>
<i>"The precise effect of the Mutual Assistance Pact was to give Poland a clear signal that aggression and belligerency was tolerable and a warning to Germany that any retaliation would be met by force."
</i> 
<br>
Sir. Basil Liddell Hart, The History of the Second World War
<br><br>
  </li>
  <li>
<i>"The last thing Hitler wanted was to produce another great war. His people, and particularly his generals, were profoundly fearful of any such risk - the experiences of World War One had scarred their minds."
</i> 
<br>

Sir. Basil Liddell Hart, The History of the Second World War

  </li>
  <li>
<i>"I believe strongly in the honourable intentions of your Fuhrer, however, tell him he should not overlook the fact that the ancient hatred of my people against everything German is abysmal."

</i>
<br>
Sir, Neville Henderson, British Ambassador to Berlin, 16th August, 1939
<br><br>
  </li>
  <li>
<i>"Poland's decision of August 30, 1939 that was the basis for general mobilization marked a turning point in the history of Europe. It forced Hitler to wage war at a time when he hoped to gain further unbloody victories."

Kazimierz Sosnkowski, Polish General and Government-in-Exile's commander-in-chief, August 31, 1943

<i>"Starting in April 1945, the United States Army and the French Army casually annihilated one million [German] men, most of them in American camps . . .

Some of the men were really only boys 13 years of age...Some of the prisoners were old men drafted by Hitler in his last ditch stand ... I understand that average weight of the prisoners at Andernach was 90 pounds, 44kg, ...I have received threats ...

<i>"When we reached Metgethen, we were confronted with a gruesome sight: We found several hundred dead German soldiers, many of whom had been disfigured beyond recognition. There were murdered civilians in just about every home, likewise disfigured in a most bestial manner. For example, some women had their breasts cut off, and in backyard gardens we found scarcely clad women who had been hanged upside down. In one house we came across a 63-year-old woman still alive. Crying, she told us that she had been raped by 12 to 15 Russians. She lay on the floor covered in blood. This old woman's daughter had escaped into the forest nearby, but her one-year-old child was abducted by the Russians. In the streets of Metgethen, and also at the railroad station, we found approximately15 baby carriages, some overturned, all empty. We concluded that this meant the Russians had also abducted these babies."

In the farmyard further down the road stood a cart, to which four naked women were nailed through their hands in a cruciform position. Behind the Weisser Krug towards Gumbinnen is a square with a monument to the Unknown Soldier. Beyond is another large inn, 'Roter Krug'. Near it, parallel to the road, stood a barn and to each of its two doors a naked woman was nailed through the hands, in a crucified posture. In the dwellings, we found a total of seventy-two women, including children, and one old man, 74, all dead ... all murdered in a bestial manner, except only for a few who had bullet holes in their necks. Some babies had their heads bashed in. In one room we found a woman, 84 years old, sitting on a sofa ... half of whose head had been sheared off with an axe or a spade ... We carried the corpses to the village cemetery where they lay to await a foreign medical commission ... In the meantime, a nurse from Insterburg came, a native of Nemmersdorf, who looked for her parents. Among the corpses were her mother, 72, and her father, 74, the only man among the dead. She also established that all the dead were Nemmersdorfers. On the fourth day the bodies were buried in two graves. Only on the following day did the medical commission arrive, and the tombs had to be reopened. Barn doors were set on blocks on which to lay the bodies so that the commission could examine them. This foreign commission unanimously established that all the women, as well as the girls from eight to twelve years and even the woman of 84 years had been raped. After the examination by the commission, the bodies were again buried."

<i>"The Polish terror in the Ukraine today is worse than anything else in Europe. Ukraine became a country of desperation and destruction. The murderous deeds multiplied. The Germans have been tortured, mutilated, excruciated to death, their corpses were desecrated. Villages and palaces have been robbed, ignited, blown up. The depicted incidents in the official publication of the German government in 1921 exceed the worst actions one can imagine."

The present generation will see that a new victory at Grunwald will be written into historys pages. But we will battle out this Grunwald in the suburbs of Berlin. Our ideal is to chamfer Poland with borders along the Oder in the west and the Neie at Lausitz and to absorb Prussia from Pregel to the Spree.

This policy is ruthlessly established and without any attention to the public opinion of the world, of international contracts or the League of Nations. The Ukraine turned to hell under Polish rule. One can say this about Belorussia with even more right. The purpose of the Polish policy is the disappearance of the national minorities on the paper and in reality."

The Germans have been tortured, mutilated, excruciated to death, their corpses were desecrated. Villages and palaces have been robbed, ignited, blown up. The depicted incidents in the official publication of the German government in 1921 exceed the worst actions one can imagine."
